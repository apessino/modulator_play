Check out this video for an introduction to the application and crate!

An environment to visualize and test the modulator crate and to experiment with
expressive 2d primitive rendering. Based on Piston Window, this application is
meant to be both a test bed for the Modulator crate and its included source types,
and a minimal friction environment to experiment with Rust coding.

The best way to get familiar with this application, what it can do and how it relates to the Modulator crate, is to watch the video linked above.

Assuming you have Rust properly installed (if not [go get it now, it is awesome](https://www.rust-lang.org)), to run the application, clone or download this repository, then ```cd``` to the directory and:

    cargo run --release

You can skip the --release to build and run the application in debug.
